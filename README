LICENSE

  In a perfect world, I could just say that this package and all of the
  code it contains is Public Domain. It's a bit more complicated than
  that; you'll have to read LICENSE to get the full details.

  Here are some nice things to live by:
  1. Give credit where it's due.
  2. Share your modifications, so everyone benefits from them.
  3. Do something nice for the authors.
  4. Help someone who needs it.
  5. Don't waste. Anything. Be especially careful not to waste energy that
     comes from non-renewable sources.
  6. Be tolerant. Everything that's good in nature comes from cooperation.
