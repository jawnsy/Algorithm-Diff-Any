=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple module to select the best available implementation of the
standard C<diff> algorithm, which works by effectively trying to solve the
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. This algorithm is described in:
I<A Fast Algorithm for Computing Longest Common Subsequences>, CACM, vol.20,
no.5, pp.350-353, May 1977.

However, it is algorithmically rather complicated to solve the LCS problem;
for arbitrary sequences, it is an NP-hard problem. Simply comparing two
strings together of lengths I<n> and I<m> is B<O(n x m)>. Consequently, this
means the algorithm necessarily has some tight loops, which, for a dynamic
language like Perl, can be slow.

In order to speed up processing, a fast (C/XS-based) implementation of the
algorithm's core loop was implemented. It can confer a noticable performance
advantage (benchmarks show a 54x speedup for the C<compact_diff> routine).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Algorithm::Diff::Any;

  my $diff = Algorithm::Diff::Any->new(\@seq1, \@seq2);

For complete usage details, see the Object-Oriented interface description
for the L<Algorithm::Diff> module.

=head1 PURPOSE

The intent of this module is to provide single simple interface to the two
(presumably) compatible implementations of this module, namely,
L<Algorithm::Diff> and L<Algorithm::Diff::XS>.

If, for some reason, you need to determine what version of the module is
actually being included by C<Algorithm::Diff::Any>, then:

  print 'Backend type: ', $Algorithm::Diff::Any::DRIVER, "\n";

In order to force use of one or the other, simply load the appropriate module:

  use Algorithm::Diff::XS;
  my $diff = Algorithm::Diff::XS->new();
  # or
  use Algorithm::Diff;
  my $diff = Algorithm::Diff->new();

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This module was tested under Perl 5.10.1, using Debian Linux. However, because
it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be compatible
with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite modules.

If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture, please
contact the maintainer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Algorithm::Diff::Any->new( \@seq1, \@seq2, [ \%opts ] )

Creates a C<Algorithm::Diff::Any> object, based upon either the optimized
C/XS version of the algorithm, L<Algorithm::Diff::XS>, or falls back to
the Pure Perl implementation, L<Algorithm::Diff>.

Example code:

  my $diff = Algorithm::Diff->new( \@seq1, \@seq2 );

This method will return an appropriate B<Algorithm::Diff::Any> object or
throw an exception on error.

    unless (ref($seq1) eq 'ARRAY' && ref($seq2) eq 'ARRAY');

  my $self = {
  };

  if ($DRIVER eq 'XS') {
    $self->{backend} = Algorithm::Diff::XS->new($seq1, $seq2, $opts);

Many thanks go to the primary authors and maintainers of the Pure Perl
implementation of this algorithm, notably:

Thanks to Audrey Tang <cpan@audreyt.org>, author of L<Algorithm::Diff::XS>,
for recognizing the value of Joe Schaefer's <apreq-dev@httpd.apache.org>
work on L<Algorithm::LCS>

=item *

Neither the Pure Perl nor C/XS-based implementations of this module would
have been possible without the work of James W. Hunt (Stanford University)
and Thomas G. Szymanski (Princeton University), authors of the often-cited
paper for computing longest common subsequences.

In their abstract, they claim that a running time of B<O(n log n)> can be
expected, with a worst-case time of B<O(n^2 log n)> for two subsequences of
length I<n>.

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 KNOWN BUGS

There are no known bugs as of this release.

=head2 LIMITATIONS

=over

=item *

It is not currently known whether L<Algorithm::Diff> (Pure Perl version)
and L<Algorithm::Diff::XS> (C/XS implementation) produce the same output.
The algorithms may not be equivalent (source code-wise) so they may produce
different output under some as-yet-undiscovered conditions.

=item *

Any potential performance gains will be limited by those features implemented
by L<Algorithm::Diff::XS>. As of time of writing, this is limited to the
C<cdiff> subroutine.

Yes, the test coverage is pretty abysmal in some areas. I'm working on it.
